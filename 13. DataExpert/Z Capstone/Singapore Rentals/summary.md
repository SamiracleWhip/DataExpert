# Singapore Rental Intelligence Dashboard — Build Summary

---

## Project Overview

A geospatial dashboard visualising private residential rental prices across Singapore using official URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority) transaction data. Users can explore rental prices by district, track trends over time per building and zone, and filter by property parameters. A Claude-powered assistant will answer natural language queries about the data.

**Data source:** URA Data Service API — private residential rental contracts submitted to IRAS for Stamp Duty assessment.

---

## Step 1: URA API Setup & Historical Data Pull

### 1.1 Registration

Registered for a URA API access key at:
`https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/maps/api/reg.html`

Upon approval, URA emails an **Access Key** (a permanent credential). This was stored in a `.env` file:

```
URA_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

### 1.2 Protecting the Access Key

A `.gitignore` was created immediately to prevent the `.env` file from being accidentally committed to git. The git repository root is at `/Users/samirbhojwani/Documents`, covering the entire Documents folder, making this protection critical.

`.gitignore` covers: `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.DS_Store`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `.venv/`, `venv/`

### 1.3 How the URA API Works

The URA API uses a **two-step authentication** system:

1. **Access Key** — permanent, received by email, stored in `.env`
2. **Token** — generated fresh each day using the Access Key, valid for that day only

**Token generation endpoint:**
```
GET https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/uraDataService/insertNewToken/v1
Header: AccessKey: <your_access_key>
```

**Data retrieval endpoint:**
```
GET https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/uraDataService/invokeUraDS/v1?service=PMI_Resi_Rental&refPeriod=25q1
Headers: AccessKey: <your_access_key>
         Token: <today's_token>
```

`refPeriod` is in `yyqq` format — e.g. `25q1` = 2025 Q1.

### 1.4 Technical Quirks

Two issues were discovered when calling the API from Python:

1. **Self-signed SSL certificate** — URA's server uses a self-signed certificate. Fixed by setting `verify=False` in requests and suppressing the warning with `urllib3.disable_warnings()`.
2. **Bot detection** — URA's server blocks Python's default User-Agent. Fixed by setting `User-Agent: curl/8.4.0` in all request headers.

### 1.5 Data Scope Decision

**Excluded property types:** `Semi-Detached House` and `Detached House` were excluded upstream in the fetch script at the user's request. These are landed private housing not relevant to the rental intelligence use case.

**Kept property types:**
| Type | Share |
|---|---|
| Non-landed Properties (condos/apartments) | 92.1% |
| Terrace House | 2.8% |
| Executive Condominium | 2.3% |

**Not included:** HDB flats — this is a URA dataset covering private residential properties only. HDB data is managed separately by the HDB agency.

**Bedroom data:** 13.6% of contracts have `"NA"` for number of bedrooms. This is expected — the URA API notes bedroom info is not always provided. These records are stored with `NULL` in the database (not the string "NA") for cleaner SQL filtering.

### 1.6 The Fetch Script (`fetch_historical.py`)

Pulls all quarters from 2022 Q1 to 2026 Q1 (17 quarters total), applies the property type filter, and saves to `raw_rental_contracts_all.json`.

**Quarters covered:** `22q1` through `26q1`

**Output structure:**
```json
{
  "22q1": [ { "project": "...", "street": "...", "x": "...", "y": "...", "rental": [...] } ],
  "22q2": [ ... ],
  ...
}
```

Each rental contract contains: `leaseDate` (mmyy format), `propertyType`, `district`, `areaSqft`, `areaSqm`, `noOfBedRoom`, `rent`.

**Results:**
- 17 quarters fetched
- 43,220 project-level records (before deduplication)
- Saved to `raw_rental_contracts_all.json`

---

## Step 2: SQLite Database

### 2.1 Why SQLite

SQLite was chosen for simplicity — no server setup required, queryable with standard SQL. After deduplication, the dataset contains ~336,000 unique contracts across 4,230 buildings. At ~20,000 new unique contracts per quarter, even 5 years of future growth keeps the database well under 1 million rows — well within SQLite's practical limits. File size: 56.5 MB.

### 2.2 Schema

Three tables:

**`districts`** — static lookup table mapping district codes to area names
```sql
CREATE TABLE districts (
    district  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- e.g. "10"
    area_name TEXT NOT NULL        -- e.g. "Ardmore, Bukit Timah, Holland Road, Tanglin"
);
```

28 Singapore postal districts (D01–D28) are seeded at load time.

**`buildings`** — one row per unique property
```sql
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project TEXT NOT NULL,
    street  TEXT NOT NULL,
    x       REAL,   -- SVY21 x coordinate (from URA)
    y       REAL,   -- SVY21 y coordinate (from URA)
    lat     REAL,   -- WGS84 latitude (added in Step 3)
    lng     REAL,   -- WGS84 longitude (added in Step 3)
    UNIQUE(project, street)
);
```

**`rental_contracts`** — one row per unique rental contract
```sql
CREATE TABLE rental_contracts (
    id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    building_id    INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES buildings(id),
    lease_year     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    lease_month    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    property_type  TEXT,
    district       TEXT REFERENCES districts(district),
    area_sqft      TEXT,    -- stored as range string e.g. "1000-1100"
    area_sqm       TEXT,    -- stored as range string e.g. "100-110"
    no_of_bedrooms TEXT,    -- NULL where URA did not provide bedroom info
    rent           INTEGER NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(building_id, lease_year, lease_month, property_type,
           district, area_sqft, no_of_bedrooms, rent)
);
```

Indexes are created on `building_id`, `district`, `lease_year/month`, and `no_of_bedrooms` for query performance.

### 2.3 Deduplication

The URA API returns up to 5 years of history per quarter call. This means the same rental contract appears in multiple quarters. Deduplication is handled via the `UNIQUE` constraint on `rental_contracts` — duplicate inserts are silently ignored using `INSERT OR IGNORE`.

**Deduplication results:**
- Raw contracts across all quarters: 367,497
- Unique contracts loaded: 336,751
- Duplicates skipped: 30,746

### 2.4 Load Script (`load_to_sqlite.py`)

Reads `raw_rental_contracts_all.json`, creates the database, seeds districts, and loads all data. `leaseDate` (mmyy format e.g. `"0125"`) is parsed into separate `lease_year` (2025) and `lease_month` (1) columns.

**Final database contents:**
| Table | Rows |
|---|---|
| districts | 28 |
| buildings | 4,230 |
| rental_contracts | 336,751 |

---

## Step 3: Geocoding Buildings

The URA API provides building coordinates in **SVY21 format** — Singapore's local projected coordinate system. These need to be converted to standard **WGS84 lat/lng** for use on web maps.

### 3.1 Strategy

Two-step approach:

1. **SVY21 → WGS84 conversion** for the 4,099 buildings that already have URA coordinates — done mathematically using the `pyproj` library (EPSG:3414 → EPSG:4326). Instant, no API calls needed.
2. **OneMap API geocoding** for the 131 buildings with missing URA coordinates — search by project name + street using Singapore's official geocoding service at `https://www.onemap.gov.sg/api/common/elastic/search`.

### 3.2 OneMap API Note

The OneMap API returns results without authentication but includes a warning: `"Authentication token missing. Please create an account and generate or renew your API Token."` This is a soft warning — results are valid. For future re-runs, registering for a free OneMap account at developers.onemap.sg is recommended in case they enforce authentication.

### 3.3 Results

| Method | Buildings |
|---|---|
| SVY21 conversion | 4,099 |
| OneMap geocoded | 58 |
| Not geocoded | 73 |
| **Total geocoded** | **4,157 (98.3%)** |

The 73 ungeocodable buildings are generic entries like `"LANDED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT"` with no specific project name — OneMap has nothing to search against. These are a negligible fraction and will simply not appear on the map.

**Coordinate validation:** All lat/lng values fall within Singapore's geographic bounds (lat: 1.24–1.46, lng: 103.69–103.98). ✅
